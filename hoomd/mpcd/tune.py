class ParticleSorter(TriggeredOperation):
    r"""MPCD particle sorter.

    Args:
        trigger (hoomd.trigger.trigger_like): Select the time steps on which to
            sort.

    This tuner sorts the MPCD particles into cell order. To perform the sort,
    the cell list is first computed with the current particle order. Particles
    are then reordered in memory as they are stored in the cell list, which can
    significantly improve performance of all subsequent cell-based steps of the
    MPCD algorithm due to improved cache coherency.

    The optimal frequency for sorting depends on the number of particles, so the
    `trigger` itself should be tuned to give the maximum performance. The
    trigger's period should be a multiple of
    `hoomd.mpcd.collide.CollisionMethod.period` to avoid unnecessary cell list
    builds. Typically, using a small multiple (tens) of the collision period
    works best.

    To achieve the best performance, the `hoomd.mpcd.tune.ParticleSorter`
    is not added to `hoomd.Operations.tuners`. Instead, set it in
    `hoomd.mpcd.Integrator.mpcd_particle_sorter`.

    Essentially all MPCD systems benefit from sorting, so it is recommended
    to use one for all simulations!

run DPD simulations with surfaces.

class BounceBack(Method):
    r"""Velocity Verlet integration method with bounce-back from surfaces.

    Args:
        filter (hoomd.filter.filter_like): Subset of particles on which to
            apply this method.
        geometry (hoomd.mpcd.geometry.Geometry): Surface to bounce back from.

    A bounce-back method for integrating solutes (MD particles) embedded in an
    MPCD fluid. The integration scheme is velocity Verlet with bounce-back
    performed at the solid boundaries defined by a geometry, as in
    `hoomd.mpcd.stream.BounceBack`. This gives a simple approximation of the
    interactions required to keep a solute bounded in a geometry, and more
    complex interactions can be specified, for example, by writing custom
    external fields.

    Similar caveats apply to these methods as for
    `hoomd.mpcd.stream.BounceBack`. In particular:

    1. The simulation box is periodic, but the `geometry` may impose
       non-periodic boundary conditions. You must ensure that the box is
       sufficiently large to enclose the `geometry` and that all particles lie
       inside it
    2. You must also ensure that particles do not self-interact through the
       periodic boundaries. This is usually achieved for simple pair potentials
       by padding the box size by the largest cutoff radius. Failure to do so
       may result in unphysical interactions.
    3. Bounce-back rules do not always enforce no-slip conditions at surfaces
       properly. It may still be necessary to add additional "ghost" MD
       particles in the surface to achieve the right boundary conditions and
       reduce density fluctuations.

    Warning:
        This method does not support anisotropic integration because torques are
        not computed for collisions with the boundary. Rigid bodies will also
        not be treated correctly because the integrator is not aware of the
        extent of the particles. The surface reflections are treated as point
        particles. These conditions are too complicated to validate easily, so
        it is the user's responsibility to choose the `filter` correctly.

    .. code-block:: python

        plates = hoomd.mpcd.geometry.ParallelPlates(separation=6.0)
        nve = hoomd.mpcd.methods.BounceBack(
            filter=hoomd.filter.All(), geometry=plates
        )
